# Welcome to the Checkers game project!

This project aims to provide a fun and easy way for younger people to learn and play the classic game of Checkers. I noticed that there were not many Checkers games available on the MacOS App Store, so I decided to create one that is not only enjoyable but also educational. 

The project is completed for the WWDC23 Student Scholarships Submission, and during the experienced of developing this project, I learned a lot about the Swift language and Swift Playground. Many thanks for the Apple Teams which such a great opportunity for students to learn about Swift.

## Features

Two main options: VS Player and VS Computer, which allow players to either play with another person or with the computer.
An easy mode for the computer bot, which applies a little bit of Machine Learning algorithm to make the game more accessible to beginners.
A "How to Play" button that provides a quick guide for anyone who is new to the game.

## Technologies Used

SwiftUI: A modern declarative framework used to build user interfaces across Apple platforms. We utilized this library to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
AVFoundation: A framework used for working with time-based audiovisual media in iOS, macOS, and tvOS. We incorporated sound effects into the game to make it more engaging and interactive.

## Getting Started

1. Download Swift Playground from Apps Store.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

4. Build and run the project on your Mac device (remember to put on full-screen).
